## Fashion-MNIST Image Classification with CNN
This code demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Requirements-:
TensorFlow
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Pandas

## Usage
Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset
Normalize the pixel values
Define the CNN model
Compile the model
Train the model
Evaluate the model on the test set
Plot the training and validation accuracy
Plot the training and validation loss
Create a confusion matrix
Plot confusion matrix as heatmap
Calculate accuracy for each category
Print accuracy for each category

The file contains two models ie CNN and NN model which have different accuracies ie. CNN around 90-91% wheras NN have accurracy of 88%.

Feel Free to make changes by pulling request and use this model. Donot forget to leave a star.
